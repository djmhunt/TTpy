    Attributes
    ----------
    Name : string
        The name of the class used when recording what has been used.
    currAction : int
        The current action chosen by the model. Used to pass participant action
        to model when fitting

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha : float, optional
        Learning rate parameter
    epsilon : float, optional
        Noise parameter. The larger it is the less likely the model is to choose the highest expected reward
    number_actions : integer, optional
        The maximum number of valid actions the model can expect to receive.
        Default 2.
    number_cues : integer, optional
        The initial maximum number of stimuli the model can expect to receive.
         Default 1.
    number_critics : integer, optional
        The number of different reaction learning sets.
        Default number_actions*number_cues
    action_codes : dict with string or int as keys and int values, optional
        A dictionary used to convert between the action references used by the
        task or dataset and references used in the models to describe the order
        in which the action information is stored.
    prior : array of floats in ``[0, 1]``, optional
        The prior probability of of the states being the correct one.
        Default ``ones((number_actions, number_cues)) / number_critics)``
    expect: array of floats, optional
        The initialisation of the expected reward.
        Default ``ones((number_actions, number_cues)) * 5 / number_cues``
    stimFunc : function, optional
        The function that transforms the stimulus into a form the model can
        understand and a string to identify it later. Default is blankStim
    rewFunc : function, optional
        The function that transforms the reward into a form the model can
        understand. Default is blankRew
    decFunc : function, optional
        The function that takes the internal values of the model and turns them
        in to a decision. Default is model.decision.discrete.weightProb
