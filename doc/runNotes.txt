
Open a command line in "./doc" and run the following line if you have added 
new modules (OR add them by hand!):

sphinx-apidoc -o . ../ -f -d 4

For now this generates documentation hooks for things that should not be 
documented, so you will need to go through the rst pages by hand.

Once you have done so or if you do not need to do so, then run:

make html
