   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

PyDM!
================================

This code has been tested using ``Python 2.7``. Apart from the standard Python libraries it also depends on the `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ libraries. For those installing Python for the first time I would recommend the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.

Running scripts can be found in ``./runScripts/`` where a number of scripts have been created and are updated for each model. There are also two templates: ``runScript.py`` for fitting data, currently set up for fitting data to the ``Decks`` experiment, and ``runScript_sim.py`` for simulating an experiment. A visual display of the interactions in one of these scripts will soon be created.
