        ### Prerequisites ###
        This code has been tested using ``Python 3.7``. Apart from the standard Python libraries it also depends on the [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) libraries and a few others listed in ``requirements.txt``. For those installing Python for the first time I would recommend the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
        
        ### Installation ###
        For now this is just Python code that you download and use, not a package.
        
        ### Usage ###
        The framework can been run with a run script, live in a terminal or Python command-line (or [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)).
        
        A task simulation can be simply created by running ``simulation.run()``. Equally, for fitting participant data, the function is ``dataFitting.run('./path/to/data/')``.
        
        More complex example running scripts can be found in ``./runScripts/``. Here, a number of scripts have been created as templates: ``runScript_sim.py`` for simulating the ``probSelect`` task and ``runScript_fit.py`` for fitting the data generated from ``runScript_sim.py``, stored in the ``./tests/test_sim`` folder. The output of this fit can also be found ``./tests/test_fit`` folder.
        
        A new method of passing in the fitting or simulation configuration is to use a YAML configuration file. This is done, for both simulations and data fitting, using the function ``start.run_config`` For example, to run the YAML configuration equivalent to the ``runScript_sim.py`` from a command line would be :``start.run_config('./runScripts/runScripts_sim.yaml')``. For the fitting example, the configuration equivalent to ``runScript_fit.py`` would be :``start.run_config('./runScripts/runScripts_fit.yaml')``.
        
        ### Documentation ###
        [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ttpy/badge/?version=latest)](https://ttpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
        
        The documentation can be found on [readthedocs](https://ttpy.readthedocs.io) or in ``./doc/_build/html``, with the top level file being ``index.html``.
        
        To update the documentation you will need to install Sphinx and a set of extensions. The list of extensions can be found in ``./doc/conf.py``. The list of extensions can be found in ``./doc/requirements.txt``. To update the documentation follow the instruction in ``./doc/readme.md``
