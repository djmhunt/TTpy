This code has been tested using "Python 2.7.9". Apart from the standard Python libraries it also depends on the [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) libraries. For those installing Python for the first time I would recommend the Anaconda Python distribution.

A template running script can be found in ``runScript.py``

The documentation can be found in "./doc/_build/html", with the top level file being index.html

To update the documentation you will need to install Sphinx and a set of extensions. The list of extensions can be found in "./doc/conf.py". To update the documentation follow the instruction in ``./doc/runNotes.txt``
